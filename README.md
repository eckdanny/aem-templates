# cibc-templates

> Creating templates and components for AEM

## Get Started

If you don't have the `grunt-cli` and `bower` packages, install them globally with `npm i -g grunt-cli bower`.

Clone this repository, `cd` into the working directory and satisfy all dependencies with `npm i && bower i`. 

Finally, spin up dev server with `grunt server`.

## Developer Ergonomics

When spinning up a local dev server using the above command, you should notice:

 - _on-the-fly_ Sass compilation with libsass via `grunt-sass`
 - `live-reload`-enabled browser
 - Serving the `dist` (so you're looking at what gets deployed to staging site)

## Other Resources

Reading Mtrl and tool docs:

 - [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/)
 - [Assemble](http://assemble.io/docs/)

## Errata 

Just getting started with the proposed solution. Has been discussed and vetted with AEM developers. Many aspects of project, configuration, and asset pipeline are subject to change.
